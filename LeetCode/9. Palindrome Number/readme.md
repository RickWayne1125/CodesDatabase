#      9. Palindrome Number 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. 

## Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
